# MediSmart Futures: Sharp Health Predictions

Welcome to our innovative health prediction project, ["MediSmart Futures: Sharp Health Predictions"]. We're dedicated to leveraging advanced technology and data analytics to forecast heart, liver, and diabetes conditions. Our mission is to empower individuals with early insights and personalized guidance for a healthier tomorrow.
Our goal is to develop and implement predictive models that enable early detection and proactive management of heart, liver, and diabetes conditions. We aim to provide individuals with accurate risk assessments, personalized health recommendations, and the knowledge they need to make informed decisions, ultimately improving their overall well-being and quality of life.

# Dashboard
Dashboard created using The visualisation is to include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, Javascript and  database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite)to configure some of the attributes of the application. From Application configuration objects store metadata for an application.

## Project Overview

The project's scope is to provide a valuable tool for General Practitioners (GPs) in Australia. It involves developing a comprehensive healthcare prediction system that assists GPs in early detection and severity assessment of heart, liver, and diabetes conditions. The system offers personalized health recommendations and facilitates referrals to specialists when required. The project aims to empower GPs with data-driven insights, aiding in more informed decision-making and enhancing patient care. By enabling GPs to catch conditions early and offer proactive management, the project can improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs, ultimately benefiting both GPs and their patients.

This task requires the group to work cohesively to tell a story using a range of data extraction and visualisation tools.

# Requirements

# Data Model Implementation 

   * A Python script initialises, trains, and evaluates a model.

   * The data is cleaned, normalised, and standardised prior to modelling.

   * The model utilises data retrieved from SQL or Spark.

   * The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared. 

# Data Model Optimisation 

   * The model optimisation and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script itself.

   * Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script.

## Project details

# Findings and Summary
In summary, we have successfully fulfilled the project's initial objectives, which included developing predictive models and designing a user-friendly front-end interface for general physicians to assess disease probabilities in patients. Nevertheless, given the project's medical nature, the utmost importance lies in achieving a high degree of accuracy and precision in disease prediction. To this end, we propose the following strategic actions to further enhance the accuracy.

 "Our project is a comprehensive machine learning endeavor focused on predicting heart disease. We embark on this journey by meticulously preparing our data, uncovering insights through thoughtful exploration and compelling visualization. With the power of Keras, we craft a neural network model designed to unveil patterns in the data. Our dataset is cleaned, and categorical variables are artfully transformed. We divide our data into training and testing sets, ensuring a well-balanced model. As we scale the data, our neural network takes shape, learning from the training data. In the end, we evaluate our model using a confusion matrix, showcasing its predictive prowess. We also illuminate the path for future predictions, demonstrating the importance of data standardization and model scaling. The result? A powerful tool for heart disease prediction, ready to make an impact.â€œ

# Data Preprocessing and Exploration:
  * Data is loaded and explored.
  * Missing values are checked and summary statistics are calculated.
# Correlation Analysis:
  * Correlations between features are visualized using a heatmap.
# Data Visualization:
  * Scatter plots and pair plots are used to examine relationships between features and heart disease.
  * A box plot shows age distributions based on heart disease status.
# Model Building and Training:
  * A neural network model is constructed and trained.
# Model Evaluation and Deployment:
  * The model is evaluated with a confusion matrix.
  * The trained model and scaler are saved for future predictions.
